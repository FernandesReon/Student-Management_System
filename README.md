# JDBC-Student_Management
Project that interacts with MySQL database using concept of <em>JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)</em>.<br>
JDBC is nothing but a process through which we interact with Database using Java code that allow us<br>
to perform CRUD operation.<br>
To make this project look cleaner and simpler. I have divided the project into 5 different modules.
<br>
Each module is responsible for functions in the project like <em>Establishing connection with Database</em>, for <em>SQL queries</em> and so on.

1. Before writing the code for module that allows us to connect with Database make sure to <em>create a Database and Table</em> using <em>MySQL Command Line.</em><br>
2.To get the <em><u>username</u></em> --> type --> <em><u>select user();</u></em> in MySQL Command Line.
  To get port <em><u>number</u></em> --> type --> <em><u>select @@port;</u></em> in MySQL Command Line.
