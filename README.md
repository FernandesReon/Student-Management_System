# JDBC-Student_Management
Project that interacts with MySQL database using the concept of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).<br>
JDBC is nothing but a process through which we interact with a Database using Java code that allows us<br>
to perform CRUD operations.<br>
To make this project look cleaner and simpler. I have divided the project into 5 different modules.<br>
Each module is responsible for functions in the project like <em>Establishing connection with Database</em>, for <em>SQL queries</em>, and so on.
